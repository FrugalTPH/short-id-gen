# short-id-gen
 
A console-based service I built to generate short uid's for use in business documents (e.g. quote & purchase order numbers etc).

I have this set up in Windows so that when I hit Windows-key & type "id", then hit enter, the app executes and places the generated ID number onto my clipboard.
